----------------------------------------------
-2009 -> 2018
-not a detector taking physics data, but as safety measure
-situated in 2 stations upstream of magnet

BCM before LS2 upgrade:
-fast particle flux measurement system
-2 rings with 8 diamond sensors at 2 z-positions around
-BCM-U is upstream of the VELO
-BCM-D is downsteam of of TT (previous -> now UT)

-200 V bias voltage
-current through diamonds is read out by current-to-frequency converter (CFC) cards [these were originally designed for LHC beam loss monitor]
-CFC cards integration time = 40 micro seconds
-CFC cards measurement range = (2.5 pico Amp (pA), 1 milli Amp (mA))
--> this is adequate for BCM diamonds since they show dark current in pico Amp range and dump threshold in micro Amp range
-digitized signal sent through redundant optical fibres with rate of 125kHz to TELL1 readout board
-firmware of TELL1 board applies "beam dump" logic to determine wether measured flux values are in problematic ranges
-TELL1 board located in D3 rack behind shielding wall in cavern where are UI is located
-> UI can do:
--> 1.) when conditions are met TELL1 can request beam dump
--> 2.) can inhibit injection of further bunches
-post-mortem trigger: request a snapshot of systems current data
-possible to send signal to VELO to open and move into safe position

-during last months of LHC run 2 problems with BCM emerged
-> multiple diamonds showed excessive currents during normal LHC conditions
-cause: maybe radiation damage

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
upgraded BCM system: 2019 -> 2022

-all  subddetectors getting a new readout hardware
-TELL1 FPGA readout board is getting deprecated
-new LHCb wide used readout boards used -> PCIe40 (BCM40 is the variant for BCM called)
-> this board will be implemented in the new data center above ground with CIBU stauing in the cavern it will need an extra component:
--> MIBAD board: machine interface and beam abort decision board
-featuring Intel Arriva FPGA  will be placed in the same rack as TELL1 was previously
-> handles low level parts of BCM system:
1: receiving the read-out data
2: implementing beam-dump logic
3: interfacing to the machine

-> this data is tunneled to BCM40 at surface center
-Using BCM40 as interface to MIBAD board -> computer system housing BCM40 runs monitoring alowing observation and control of the whole system from 
the LHCb control room

BCM upgrade regarding diamonds:
-radiation damage -> sensors failed -> replacement of whole system
-to avoid said damage in the future:
-> characterization of diamond sensors with charge collection efficiency

Field Programmable Gate Arrays --> FPGAs
-integrated digital circuits
-feature high number of reconfigurable logic blocks
-output depends on input (logic based)
-use look up table
-page 12 L Funke masterthesis: diagramm of FPGA

Diamonds Fundamentals:
-bethe bloch for energy deposition
-crystalline carbon
-2 displaced fcc lattices
-43 eV needed to remove an atom from the lattice
-high mechanical hardness
-band gap of 5.47 eV indicates isulator but can be semiconductor as well
-large band gap -> low number of charge carriers -> low dark current
-large band gap + high displcement threshold --> very radiation hard
-CCE picture on page 30

Summary:
sensitive components are placed so close to damaging beams that it needs to be continuously monitored -> BCM used for that







------------------------------------------
More BCM from David Rolf:

protecting the detector elements from possib;e damage such as radiation
BCM is constructed as a safety system to prevent potential damage
-> if happens: request beam dump to rpevent detector from being damaged
BCM U and BCM D

each has in symetrical shape...
- 8 polycrystalline chemical vapor deposited diamond sensors (pCVD)
- sensitive area: 10mm x 10mm and 0.5mm thick
diamond sensors are chosen because
- very radiation hard
- charge collection capabilities very suitable for operation close to beam pipe

Run 1 a 2, BCM operated successfully.
Beam needed dump -> BCM was necessary!
End of Run 2: 2 sesnors showed some damage -> being refurbished for Run 3
