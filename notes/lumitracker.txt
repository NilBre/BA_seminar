brief info from Lukas Rolf masterthesis:

lumitracker purpose: provide measurement of luminosity by operating independently from the rest of the LHCb experiment
how does it do it?
-> measures luminosity by reconstructing and counting tracks and also measures the luminous region by extending these tracks to the interaction point.
Reconstruction in real-time needed!
