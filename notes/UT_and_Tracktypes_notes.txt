brief notes from L funkte masterarbeit:

-silicon strip tracker with 100 - 200 micro metre pitch
-4 tracking planes
-arranged in X-U-V-X stereo pattern
-U and V are rotated by +- 5 degrees too achieve 2D spatial resolution while suppressing ghost hits in reconstruction
-

for momentum measurements there is a 4Tm (Tesla metre) integrated magnetic field between UT and SciFi

Tracktypes:
Tracks inside VELO: VELO track
Long Tracks: extended VELO Tracks matches hits in UT and SciFi
Upstream Tracks: Tracks that leave the Detector after passing the UT
Tracks without hits in th VELO:
-> Downstream Tracks: Hits in UT and SciFi for long lived particles like Lambda and K_s
-> TTracks:only Hits in SciFi, here the seeding algorithm is used

But: TTracks found by seeding can also be found as long tracks by forward tracking -> special algorithm deletes duplicates

In general: SciFi tracker has 99% single hit efficiency
