Timepix4 Telescope:

-telescopes are tracking sensors to precisely reconstruct particle tracks
-Timepix is next gen beam telescopes based on timepix family of readout ASICs (application sepcific integrated circuits)
-Timepix4 chip: can measure time of arrival and time over threshold simultaneously -> good improvement compared to timepix3
-Timepix4 developed for VELO but also operates for other detectors
-picture, right handed coordinates
-2 arms, 4 sensor planes each, arms enclosed in dry air-filled containiers
-cooled to 15 degrees celsius
-DUT (device under test) the thing in the middle, possibly a prototype of a detector, the outer parts are the timepix
