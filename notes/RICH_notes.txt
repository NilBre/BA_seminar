brief notes from L Funke master arbeit:

-particle identification used to distinguish particles because track reco can only tell sign of particle change and momentum
-at interaction point: ring imiging cherenkov detector 1 and 2
-both detector volumes filled with flourcarbon gas -> HE particles generate cherenkov radiation
-emitted light is caught by Photomultipliers
-> reconstruct speed -> reconstruct mass -> determine particle ID
-works good for: kaons, pions, protons
-RICH1 momentum range: 2 - 40 GeV/c for high sensitivity
-RICH2 momentum range: 150 - 100 GeV/c and placed forther downstream as higher momentum particles are deflected less my magnet
