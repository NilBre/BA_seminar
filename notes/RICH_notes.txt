brief notes from L Funke master arbeit:

-particle identification used to distinguish particles because track reco can only tell 
sign of particle change and momentum
-at interaction point: ring imiging cherenkov detector 1 and 2
-both detector volumes filled with flourcarbon gas -> HE particles generate cherenkov radiation
-emitted light is caught by Photomultipliers
-> reconstruct speed -> reconstruct mass -> determine particle ID
-works good for: kaons, pions, protons
-RICH1 momentum range: 2 - 40 GeV/c for high sensitivity
-RICH2 momentum range: 150 - 100 GeV/c and placed forther downstream as higher momentum 
particles are deflected less my magnet

-measures velocity and Z
-consists of 2 radiators, an expansion volume and a photodetection plane 
-radiators make cone when charged particles fly through
-1. radiator: NaF for v/c > 0.75
-2. radiator: aerogel for v/c > 0.953
-mirror above increases detection efficiency
-10880 photosensors in PMTs
-with velocity the opening angle can be calculated
